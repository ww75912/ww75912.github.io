    <td><p class="serif">I am a freshman from University of Georgia. </p>
    <p class="serif">However, at the first 18 years of my life, I lived at Qingdao, a coastal city northeast of China. </p>
    <p class="serif">Because I lived in a coastal city in China, so I can swim, and I am good at swimming. 
	At the same time, because the topography is hilly in my home town, I don't know how to ride a bike, though I learned many times. </p>
	<p class="serif">Like most Chinese students, when I was young, my parents let me learn a lot of things, painting, playing the piano. 
	<P class="serif">I like playing the piano very much, and my favorite is Sonatina in C major, op. 36 no. 1, by Clementi. After several years, I learned the flute, and be a part of school wind band. Learn and play the music instrument make me more confident, and make more friends.</P> 
	Expect these, travel is also my habit, every summer break I will travel, and in this summer break, I plan to visit my friend in Japan, and go to some country in south Asia. Travel make me more independent, and open my eyes. </P>

  <li>My high school is the best high school in my home town Qingdao, and my high school life may be the hardest for me, but it is also valueable. </P></li>
  <li><P class="serif">Every school day, I get up at 6 and start learning, until 10, and even in Saturday, all students should go to school to take individual learning class.</P> 
  Because my high school is far away from the downtown, I have to live on campus, and there are more than four students live in one room. </P></li>
  <li><P class="serif">Although the living quanlity was not good in my high school, but I have to say that the experience in high school teach me a lot. </P></li>
  <li><P class="serif">Like how to get on well with other people, how to do can make you be popular in your class, 
  and the most important is how to study to get a good grade.</P> </li>
  <li> <p class="serif"> The first picture is the playground of my high school which I took in my room on campus.</p></li>

  <li>After I finish my high school course, I went to a school called GAC-ACT Center to prepare for American university. </li>
  <li>In GAC center, I learned more academic English, and took some courses like Business, Science, Math, and Communication. </li>
  <li>Life in GAC is much more colorful than in high school. In high school, we only have the music festivel, and the movie festivel, and thes two festivel are mix together to save time, 
  however, in GAC, we have the Christmas show, the halloween party, and any others. As for the homework, which is more interesting than stay at high school to prepare for lots of test.

  <li> Another thing I think the education from GAC is very important to me, and helpful for college or university is the style of every day teaching. All teachers talk with students by English, and we also have some presentation like university.
